I'm a Full Stack developer, looking for opportunites to continue challenging myself, building applications that will challenge the current technologies and benefit consumers.

Following a 5-year client-facing career in the healthcare sector, I wanted to do a job I not only enjoyed but would make a difference. Inspired by the technology focus in the healthcare sector, in early 2020 I found just that in software engineering. 

I have recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (London's leading programming bootcamp), learning best practice, tools and methodologies.

## Projects

A summary of the projects I'm most proud of. All developed with Test Driven Development, Object Oriented Principles, and XP/Agile methodology.
